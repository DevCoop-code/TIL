# RxSwift
Reactive Swfit framework

## ReactiveCocoa vs RxSwift
Comparison of the two most popular Functional Reactive Programming frameworks

### What is Functional Reactive Programming(FRP)?
Functional Reactive Programming is a combination of two other concepts<br>
1. **Reactive Programming**, which focuses on asynchronous data streams
2. **Functional Programming**, which emphasizes calculations via mathematical-style functions

## Reference - Swift Functional Programming
### What is Functional Programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes calculations via mathematical-style functions.<br>
Functional programming can make concurrency(동시성) and parallel processing(병렬적 처리) easier to work

### Example - Simple Array Filtering
Finds all the even numbers between 1 and 10<br>
Check the playground project: **Example_FunctionalProgramming/FilteringEvenNumbers.playground**

### Example - Reducing
Take the even numbers between 1 and 10 and compute their sum. This calls for what is known as a **reduce** function, which takes a set of inputs and generates a single output.<br>
Check the playground project: **Example_FunctionalProgramming/ReducingNumbers.playground**
